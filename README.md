# About

The bridge generator will take a Starting Number, chop it up in a large variety of smaller numbers and use the 
pieces with addition and subtraction to reach the preferred End Number.

A genetic algorithm will be used to filter, promote and reach the smallest amounts of steps to reach a fitness stressed solution that fits the End Number.

The algorithm found to reach the End Number will then be formalised to a position algorithm and used with other numbers of same length, choped up likewise and used to see if they reach other possibly interesting numbers with the found algorithm?
